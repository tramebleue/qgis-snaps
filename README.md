## Building the snap

On an Ubuntu system a snap can be built out of the `snapcraft.yaml` by running `snapcraft` in the project directory.

For a clean, system independent build it is recommanden to use the official `snapcore/snapcraft` Docker image.
Using Docker, youâ€™ll map the current directory into the container and then build the snap from that same directory:

```
docker build -t snapcraft-ubuntugis .
docker run -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD snapcraft-ubuntugis bash -c "apt update && apt upgrade -y && snapcraft clean && snapcraft"
```
